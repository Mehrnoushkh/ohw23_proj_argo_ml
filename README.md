# ohw23_proj_argo_ml

## Get argo data
Argopy
## Define which data we are going to use

## Define limits for Argo data: locations, time

## Prepare data for the Machine Learning Model

## Define some configurations on the ML model

## Apply the ML model

Develop python scripts to process Argo Floats data from GDAC. The focus will be on obtaining real-time and delayed mode core Argo (T, S and P)
Apply an unsupervised Machine Learning model (Gaussian Mixture Model - GMM), using a Profile Classification Model. With this technique, it is expected to be able to identify outliers in the data.
Apply IOOS QC on Argo data? Generate Spikes?
Apply a Dense Neural Network model on a training set of models and then test with the entire dataset


## (Optional) Generate spikes on the data

## (Optional) Apply IOOS QC on the "fake" data

## (Optional) Prepare the data for the Dense Neural Network (DNN) model

## (Optional) Apply the DNN model
